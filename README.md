## Repository name

## Dataset
[California-housing-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavatharininatesan/california-housing-dataset)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

I chose this dataset because I was curious about whether California's minimum wage workers can actually afford housing in a state known for its high cost of living. With housing insecurities affecting millions of residents, in carlifornia and the country at large, I wanted to explore the real extent of this crisis and discover whether affordable options truly exist for low-income earners across different regions of California.
